An elliptic curve is the set of solutions to a \textit{Weierstrass equation} of the form $Y^2=X^3+AX+B$.\\

What makes elliptic curves special is that it is possible to define addition in a way that transforms an elliptic curve into an abelian group (E,+):
Let $P$ and $Q$ be two points on an elliptic curve $E$, as illustrated (%TODO).
Line $L$ intersects $E$ at three points, namely $P$,$Q$ and one other point $R$. The reflection $R*{\prime}$ of $R$ across the x-axis is called the "sum of $P$ and $Q$": $P \oplus Q = R^{\prime}$
